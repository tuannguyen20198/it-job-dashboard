Frontend: SSR + ISR, WebSocket alerts, Recharts dashboards, SEO optimized.

Auth Service: JWT + OAuth, RBAC, audit logs.

Crawl Service: Puppeteer clusters, Cheerio parsing, queue-based.

Analytics: Real-time streams, batch ML, ClickHouse for analytics.

Notifications: Email, Push, In-app, Webhooks.
